# Load Balancing

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

* Client to gateway: DNS parse domain to different ip addresses. (If we have multiple data centers, DNS will find the geographically closest data center)
* Gateway to web server: reverse proxy
* web server to application server: connection pool
* database load balancing: partition / sharding

How to distribute traffic:

* random, round-robin
* min connection count
* min latency
* based on ip.

## What if load balancer crashed?
